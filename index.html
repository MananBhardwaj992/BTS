        <h2>Career</h2>
        <hr />
        <h4>2010-2014: Formation and early years</h4>
        <p>
          BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang
          Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.
          BTS was originally supposed to be a hip hop group similar to YG
          Entertainment's 1TYM, but between their initial formation and their
          debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided instead to create an idol group similar to
          Seo Taiji and Boys who were popular in the 90's. A group able to make
          socially conscious music without the restrictions K-pop bands were
          known for, able to be sincere and genuine at a time where K-pop bands
          were highly regimented. Originally slated to debut in 2011, the group
          featured on several tracks by artists like 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before
          their debut was postponed. They were later reorganized into a more
          traditional idol group. Six months prior to their debut, they began to
          gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as
          well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.
